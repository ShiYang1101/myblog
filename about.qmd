Welcome to my blog posts! I am a theoretical physics graduate, aiming to transition to the bizarre world of data. Interested in conciousness and AI (Shadow of the Mind by Roger Penrose is godsend). Could AI arise conciousness one day? I would never know. 

Proficient in Python, SQL, statistic, Tableau and machine learning algorithms.
